Important information:
1. Some textures was edited by Sprite Editor, whitch is included in 2D Package. If You don't have 2D Package, download it from Package Manager.
2. All effects was created using "Linear" color space. If You use "Gamma", effects may look different.
3. Sometimes Unity has a bag: If You change the version or upload trails via a Custome Package, when starting the demo scene, particles into trails could be invisible.
This is because Unity is changing parameters of "Emitter Velocity Mode" to "RigidBody" into the settings in Particle System. Make sure that the "Transform" is used there.
